# Step 2 - Playing with code in a sandbox!
<!-- This is how each subject should be introduced. Give the students structure so they know they can start trusting the process sooner!  -->

## _Read It_
<!-- Give them our writing of the subject then link to a few articles: Medium, Wikipedia, CSS-Tricks, W3S, MozillaDev, etc... that help give more perspective on the subject  -->
Code sandboxes are really useful tool to share ideas, play with possibilities and explore new ideas without the pressures of building your file structure, setting up your machine or depending on the console. In class we'll use [CodeSandbox](http://codesandbox.io/) to share snippets of code, give you a place to practice and find new things. 

We will also use a different Sandbox called [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) for some practice. You will be able to browse and play with CodePens as you work through the textbook. 

Using both of these Sandbox options, you will actually get to apply the concepts you just read or watched about.

There are plenty of other sandboxes to play in. [Repl.it](https://repl.it/login?goto=%2Frepls), [JSBin](https://jsbin.com/?html,js,output), [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) and [more](https://www.sitepoint.com/7-code-playgrounds/)! Get curious and explore for yourself!

## See It
<!-- Can be a video on youTube as long as it doesn't go to another code school. Eventually all video content should come from ACA. -->
* For now, checkout this cool [codepen](https://codepen.io/issey/pen/brmoZa) and explore the CodePen Community.
