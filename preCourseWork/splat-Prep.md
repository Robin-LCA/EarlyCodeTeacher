# The S.P.A.T. Method

As you journey through the world of web development, you will find that you have dedicated yourself to a lifetime of learning. All developers, all day, are researching and learning about new technologies, and better solutions to their problems. You are on track to join them in their exploration of the ever-growing wealth of knowledge in the inter-web. (And, just to be clear, there is no way to cover all of the libraries, languages, configurations and hacks out there in just 10-months!) Because of the vast landscape of development, and our limited time together, you must bring to this class, and to your personal growth, **ownership**. This is what we mean by a *growth-mindset*.

You must own your learning, your growth, and your curiosity. To help you do this, we will not only be teaching you how to code, program, and develop, but also how to learn, and how to teach yourself new skills to expand your abilities. One of the many skills we'll help you build is "*Googling*". It may sound funny, but searching the web effectively really is one of the most powerful skills you can nurture. 

## Search. Post. Ask. Teach

S.P.A.T. is an acronym for our style of passing on, maintaining, and growing in-house knowledge in our Early Code family, which also contributes to our online and in-class community and culture: make yourself better everyday, while making others around you better!

It work like this:

If you have a question, you should immediately ask yourself: “Is it my textbook?"

    1. **SEARCH** for the question using your resources

…if you don’t find what you’re asking for:

    2. **POST** your question.

Make sure you ask the question clearly, add tags, links, or screenshots and code blocks.

    3. **ASK** your question with the linked Hack Overflow post on RocketChat,

then @ your instructor to answer it. (`@all` or `@my.instructors.name`)

    4. **TEACH** the solution.

This is the most important part. If you know a question is up, go and answer it! Also, if you learn something new, pass it on to others in the form of a Hack Overflow topic. They'll find it exactly when they need it.

## Final Thoughts

Don’t underestimate the power of sharing what you know; it always comes back around!
