# Start Your Blog

<!-- This is how each subject should be introduced. Give the students structure so they know they can start trusting the process sooner!  -->

Many benefits spring from starting your own blog! To enumerate a few:

* establishing and building-up your online presence
* reflecting on your own learning and engraining the value
* sharing and connecting with others
* contributing your lessons to the community
* expressing yourself and recording your thoughts in a place you can easily return or share with others 

In class, we will use your blog for all of these reasons. Your blog will allow you to record your thoughts and lessons, share them with your instructor in order to learn how to code at a deeper level.

### Read On

<!-- Give them our writing of the subject then link to a few articles: Medium, Wikipedia, CSS-Tricks, W3S, MozillaDev, etc... that help give more perspective on the subject  -->
Progressing through the material and challenges set forth in this textbook will certainly teach you new skills and establish a great baseline of knowledge. Summarizing your learning will reinforce the knowledge you have obtained.

To ensure you are constantly improving upon your skills and knowledge base as a whole, there will be writing assignments: *Interview Questions*. The purpose of these questions is to provide you with questions pertaining to prior learning and deeper topics that might not have been covered while learning the hard-skills of coding and programming or the soft-skills of presenting.

If you don't know the answers to these questions...PERFECT! This is your chance to learn them! Use google. Search for the terms in the questions and read as much as you can find. Once you understand the terms and ideas, synthesize the answers to the questions in your blog.

The practice of blogging will do countless things for you.  Being able to summarize your learning means you are understanding at a deeper level. It will slowly yet rapidly build your knowledge of different challenges and solutions-based approaches and record them in a place for you to return to when you are preparing for interviews as a study guide...in your own words!!

1. Remember, you will be graded for the completion of your blog but also this will be a place you can return to when preparing for interviews in a few months!
1. When publishing your blogs, make sure you tag "AustinCodingAcademy", "Coding", and "Web Development" in your story.
1. Every class will end with a discussion over these questions. If you have no idea about them, ask your instructor. Nevertheless, you will need to research the topics on your own and record what you learned in a blog. You will then turn in a link with the url of the published blog in Campus Manager. Feel free to copy/paste the question into google and read about what comes up. These interview questions are meant to broaden your knowledge and cover more ground than we can possible get to in these 8 weeks. We want you to be well prepared for the rigors of interviewing for development jobs and these the answers to these questions will ensure that you have every tool you need to succeed!
