### Website Content Objective

<!-- @TODO ATTENTION: DEVELOPER, Just like the overview in the pre-homework and class lesson we want to give the students context for what they'll be practicing in this project. -->
At this point, we have learned quite a bit about HTML and CSS.  Our goal by the end of this course is that you will have your own website.  

* You have already made a copy of your Final Project during our Wireframing lesson.
