# CheckPoint 1 - Website Content

## ProjectTitle Overview

We created the structure of our website from the wireframe. Now it's time to fill in the content  

## Website Content Rubric

<!-- @TODO ATTENTION: DEVELOPER, Every Checkpoint needs a rubric. A checkpoint, after all, is a test of the skills they've learned or haven't. Be sure to specify the specifications of this project and assign them point values that equal 100 points.  -->

1. **40pts** - Brainstorm Questions answered
1. **20pts** - Heading/Nav Content
1. **20pts** - Main Content
1. **20pts** - Wireframe Structure
1. **Bonus +20pts** - Styles/Images Added (at Teacher Discretion)

### Website Content Objective

<!-- @TODO ATTENTION: DEVELOPER, Just like the overview in the pre-homework and class lesson we want to give the students context for what they'll be practicing in this project. -->

### Website Content Example

<!-- @TODO ATTENTION: DEVELOPER, A picture, mock-up, gif demo, or website the show what the students are working toward. The point is, you have experience in building apps like this and you know where they're headed. It would be more helpful if they, too, knew where they are headed. This will give the students something to reverse engineer or setup a goal post to reach. -->

### Follow-up Video - ProjectTitle

<!-- @TODO ATTENTION: DEVELOPER, This section is intended to get the students started more quickly, clarify confusion, and push them further.

1) It must be created by the ACA/Circle Education.
2) Don't give them answers but provide hints and any specific instruction that need to be followed. -->

<!-- EXAMPLE RUBRIC:

1. **20pts** - Correct files:
    * `listOfTodoItems` - component that maps over the items give to it and renders a view of each item in:
    * `todoItem` - component that lists the details of the todo item and has buttons to:
        * "Mark as Done" -or-
        * "Mark as Doing"
        * "Delete"
        * "Update"
    * All actions that happen to a todo item will be in `todoServices`
    * Each item will implement a interface/model called `ITodo` which is shaped as follows:

        ```typescript
          export interface ITodo {
            id: number;
            title: string;
            isDone: boolean;
            isDoing: boolean;
            isEditing: boolean;
          }
        ```

1. **20pts** - Can move item from one lane to the next
1. **20pts** - Can delete item
1. **20pts** - Utilizes a modal to confirm deletion of item
