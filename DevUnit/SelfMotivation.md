# Develop Series: Self Motivation

>"The best way to predict the future is to create it." - *Abraham Lincoln*

### Power of Self-Motivation

Look, you started class with us and you trust our program so far. I need you to take that trust and build it upon yourself now. I've seen our students continue their journey with coding and develop some pretty awesome projects. The difference is in how much **they believe in themselves**. This very crucial piece is why these "Develop Series" are in your textbook, to help you find that beautiful strength within yourself so you can latch on to it and take yourself wherever you want to go.

Scott Geller has a marvelous understanding of self-motivation that you can use for yourself. Tune in, turn off, and listen.
