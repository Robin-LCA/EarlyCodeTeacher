# Computer and Internet Basics

*****

**Objective:** By the end of this lesson, the student will have an understanding about what a computer, the internet, and coding is and how these things connect together by answering the discussion questions.

*****

Before we get to coding, let's understand some background about the platforms our websites will be hosted on.  As you watch and read through the lesson, keep in mind you will be answering disucssion questions at the end. 

## What makes a computer, a computer?

Since we are going to be working with computers in this course, itâ€™s useful to know what they can do and how you can make them work for you. Check out this video to know more about how computers work in more than 90% of the world!

## What is the Internet?

It seems like the internet (& WIFI) have been around for a while, but do you really know how it works? Watch this video to learn about how the internet actually started as a secret government project and how we connect our devices to a global network almost instantly.

The internet is about sending and receiving information.  Watch this video to find out the possibilities of how that information is sent.

### What is coding?

Code is written in a language that a computer can understand.  The only language a computer understands and reads is **binary**.  This is the language of **zeros** and **ones**. The letter F in binary is written as 01000110. You can imagine what one word or sentence would look like if we wrote it in binary. Fortunately for us, there are lots of different languages that will eventually get translated into binary for the computer to read.  

Whew! That's a relief, huh?  For a second there you thought you would be filling up pages with 0's and 1's.  By learning to code in different languages, you are really becoming multiligual.  You can talk to a computer and give it instructions to create a program, website, or application for a specific purpose.  

In this course we will focus on writing in HTML and CSS. These languages will eventually be read by the computer as those 0's and 1's, but we get to write  what we want to say in a format that is much easier for the human eye to read.  More on how to do that soon.

### Discuss It 

Now that you've read and watched these concepts, let's take your understanding a little deeper. Let's make sure to internalize these concepts by answering the questions below. Collaboration will help you grow as a learner.

1. What is a computer?
1. What types of computers do you know of?
1. Where did the internet come from?
1. Who owns the internet?
1. How does the internet work?
1. What are the 3 methods for sending/receiving information on the internet?
1. What are the pros and cons of each?
1. Name 3 different coding languages.

### Terminology to Know
<!-- @TODO ATTENTION: DEVELOPER, In this section, we list terms students should now and be able to discuss at this point. Be sure to list a few for the students to jot down and work with. -->
Take a look at these terms. If you don't know or can't describe any of them, take some time to teach yourself. You're a developer, which means you're also learning to develop yourself.

- Computer
- Internet
- WiFi
- Code
- Binary
- Bit

******

#### Push Yourself Further

- Do some research about the history of coding languages.  Share some interesting information with the class.
- Write out a word or two using binary.  Can you imagine what it would be like to have written this lesson using binary?
