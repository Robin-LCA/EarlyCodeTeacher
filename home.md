## COURSE-TITLE and # Objective Statement

<!-- @TODO ATTENTION: DEVELOPER, You will need to create a Mission Statement that encapsulates the objective of the entire course. This will help students understand where they'll be going and what to expect.  -->

<!-- EXAMPLE OBJECTIVE STATEMENT: By the end of the 421 course, students will have built the front-end, client-facing piece of their full-stack app for their graduation presentation. While this course will incorporate the skills learned in 221 and 321, the main focus is for students to learn a particular library for building dynamic web apps, Angular. Students will use the last two weeks of this course to complete their graduation app. 

It is important for students to understand that Angular is only one tool that can be used to build a dynamic client-facing app. Other tools include React.js, Ember, Backbone, and Vue. Students are encouraged to explore each and understand the foundations of programming to make each one useful in their future career. -->
